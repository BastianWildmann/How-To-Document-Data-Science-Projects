How-To document Data Science Projects with Microsoft Azure
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This project is part of a blog article published at `Medium`_.
We like to give you a step by step guide on how to document your Python Data
Science Project effectively as part of your machine learning model development.
The solution, we propose, ensures that your documentation is version
controlled, shipped with the source code executing your machine learning
experiment and made available to your users or co-workers using generally
available tools including sphinx, GitHub, Microsoft Azure DevOps, and Azure
storage or Azure web Services.

Problem Statement
=================

The problem statement of the Modified National Institute of Standards and
Technology database (MNIST) dataset is a large database of handwritten digits.
It is widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.
It is a classification problem with 10 classes that aims to train a machine
learning model to correctly classify handwritten digits. The MNIST
classification problem has developed into a popular example for introductory
machine learning tutorials. An extensive list of successfully trained machine
learning models can be found at the MNIST `website`_ of Yann LeCunn.

The Data Set
============

The MNIST dataset was created by combining the samples of the original
datasets from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
